# Chatbot
Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a days increasingly being used in Healthcare. Healthcare is
very important to lead a good life. However, it is very difficult to obtain the consultation with
the doctor for every health problem. The idea is to create a medical chatbot using Artificial
Intelligence that can diagnose the disease and provide basic details about the disease before
consulting a doctor. This will help to reduce healthcare costs and improve accessibility to
medical knowledge through medical Chabot. The chat bots are computer programs that use
natural language to interact with users.
The Chatbot stores the data in the database to identify the sentence keywords and
to make a query decision and answer the question. This situation can be better understood
when we travel to cities in public hospitals where low availability of doctors is a major cause
of improper treatment of patients and in some cases the resulting death. Sometimes even
doctors can make the mistake of providing appropriate treatment results in a patient's death.
To deal with such cases there is a need for a smart chatbot and Intelligent that can give advice
to doctors and sometimes even patients about what to do in such situations that ultimately
lead to the saving lives of hundreds of people. A situation because sometimes doctors can
make a mistake while looking for symptoms but a specially designed machine cannot make
such a mistake.
This AI-based medical discussion can make a decision based on the patient's
request. In this case, it uses its own database and in some cases where something is not
available in its database at the request of the user, it collects information from a search engine
like Google and provides it to the user in Audio format as Google does.
